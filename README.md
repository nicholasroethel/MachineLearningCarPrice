# MachineLearningCarPrice
This repository contains a series of Python programs that use machine learning techniques to predict the price of a used car on craigslist. 

This project was a class assignment for ECE 470 at UVic. The project included the following questions:

The data set used can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucksdata/downloads/craigslist-carstrucks-data.zip/7 .
There are 2 spreadsheets in the dataset, but “craigslistVehiclesFull.csv “ was used and was renamed to "craigslistVehiclesFull.csv". Please note, this file was too large to be provided in the repository. 

The dataset consists of all cities in the United States. We want to predict a
used car price only in Los Angeles. Please execute following steps:
(a)Extract Los Angeles information
(b)Reduce the number of attributes to those which are more important in
price prediction (has the most variance with respect to price)
(c)Deal with lost data and outliners (Data cleaning)
(d)Shuffle the dataset and split it into a training set and test set (e.g. 80%
training 20% test)
(e)Use your favourite machine learning language and packages and train
a decision tree to predict a used car price. Be aware of overfitting and
prune your tree if needed.
(f) Report the training performance using 10-fold cross validation.
(g)Report the testing performance.
