# MachineLearningCarPrice
This repository contains a series of Python programs that use machine learning techniques to predict the price of a used car on craigslist. 

This project was a class assignment for ECE 470 at UVic. The data set used can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data/downloads/craigslist-carstrucks-data.zip/7 . There are 2 spreadsheets in the dataset, but “craigslistVehiclesFull.csv “ was used and was renamed to "craigslistVehiclesFull.csv". Please note, this file was too large to be provided in the repository. 

The project included the following questions:

(a)Extract the listings only made in Los Angeles

(b)Reduce the number of attributes to 3, choosing the 3 attrbibutes that effect the price the most

(c)Remove all lost data and outliers

(d)Randomly shuffle the dataset and split it into a 80/20 training/test split

(e)Train a decision tree to predict a used car price using your favorite machine learning packages and algorithms

(f)Report the training performance witg 10-fold cross validation

(g)Show the testing performance
